# NRFLib
An arduino library to interface with Mini - NRF24L01 modules 
Copyright 2016 Simon Harst

I have found that the libraries that are currently available on the internet don't work with the mini version of the NRF24L01 PCB with 1.27" SMD connectors - so I wrote my own library. It has only been tested on Attiny84 microcontrollers with the arduino-tiny core.
